        <p>
            Experiments were performed using a Freedom Evo 200 automated platform with a 96-channel (MCA96) head with
            EVOware software (version 3.2) (Tecan Inc., Männedorf, Switzerland). The system also includes an Inheco
            heating block and cooling block (Inheco, Munich, Germany). Six standard controls were tested in each run:
            buspirone, propranolol, diclofenac, loperamide, carbamazepine and antipyrine. The assay incubation system
            consisted of 0.5 mg/mL of rat microsomal protein (Strain: Sprague-Dawley), 1.0 μM drug concentration, and
            NADPH regeneration system (containing 0.650 mM NADP+, 1.65 mM glucose 6-phosphate, 1.65 mM MgCl2, and 0.2
            unit/mL G6PDH) in 100 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. The incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 15 min. The
            reaction was quenched by adding 555 μL of acetonitrile containing 0.28 μM albendazole, an internal standard.
            After a 20-minute centrifugation at 3000 rpm at 4°C, 30 μL of the supernatant was transferred to an analysis
            plate and was diluted five-fold using 1:2 v/v acetonitrile/water. Sample quantification and analysis was
            performed using a previously described method (Shah et al., 2016) with minor modifications. t1/2 values were
            capped at 30 minutes since for a 15 minute assay, the data cannot be extrapolated beyond 30 minutes (Di et
            al., 2004).
