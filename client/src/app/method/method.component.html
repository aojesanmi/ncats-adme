        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Experiments were performed using a Freedom Evo 200 automated platform with a 96-channel (MCA96) head
            with EVOware software (version 3.2) (Tecan Inc., Männedorf, Switzerland). The system also includes an
            Inheco heating block and cooling block (Inheco, Munich, Germany). Six standard controls were tested in
            each run: buspirone, propranolol, diclofenac, loperamide, carbamazepine and antipyrine. The assay
            incubation system consisted of 0.5 mg/mL of rat microsomal protein (Strain: Sprague-Dawley), 1.0 μM drug
            concentration, and NADPH regeneration system (containing 0.650 mM NADP+, 1.65 mM glucose 6-phosphate,
            1.65 mM MgCl2, and 0.2 unit/mL G6PDH) in 100 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. The incubation was carried
            out at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction was quenched by adding 555 μL of acetonitrile containing 0.28 μM
            albendazole, an internal standard. After a 20-minute centrifugation at 3000 rpm at 4°C, 30 μL of the
            supernatant was transferred to an analysis plate and was diluted five-fold using 1:2 v/v
            acetonitrile/water. Sample quantification and analysis was performed using a previously described method
            (Shah et al., 2016) with minor modifications. The t<sub>1/2</sub> values were capped at 30 minutes since for a
            15-minute assay, the data cannot be extrapolated beyond 30 minutes (Di et al., 2004).

        <h3>PAMPA Assay Protocol:</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            The stirring double-sink PAMPA method patented by pION Inc. (Billerica, MA) was
            employed to determine the permeability of compounds via PAMPA passive diffusion.
            The PAMPA lipid membrane, which consisted of an artificial membrane of a proprietary
            lipid mixture and dodecane (Pion Inc.), was optimized to predict gastrointestinal tract (GIT)
            passive diffusion permeability. This membrane was immobilized on a plastic matrix of a 96
            well “donor” filter plate placed below a 96 well “acceptor” plate. This artificial membrane
            mimicked the GIT membrane in the human body. Both “donor” and “acceptor” wells were
            buffered to pH 7.4. The test articles, stocked in 10 mM DMSO solutions, were diluted to
            0.05 mM in aqueous buffer (pH 7.4) and the concentration of DMSO was 0.5% in the final
            solution. During the 30-minute permeation period at room temperature the test samples in
            the donor compartment were stirred using the Gutbox technology (Pion Inc.) to reduce the
            unstirred water layer. The test article concentrations in the “donor” and “acceptor”
            compartments were measured using a UV plate reader (Nano Quant, Infinite® 200 PRO,
            Tecan Inc., Männedorf, Switzerland). Permeability calculations were performed using Pion
            Inc. software and were expressed in the units of 10<sup>-6</sup>cm/s.

        <h3>Solubility Assay Protocol:</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Pion’s patented µSOL assay was used for kinetic solubility determination. In this assay, the classical saturation shake-flask solubility method was adapted as previously described by Avdeef et al., 2001. Test compounds were prepared in 10 mM DMSO stock and diluted to a final drug concentration of 150 µM in the aqueous solution (pH 7.4, 100 mM phosphate buffer). Samples were incubated at room temperature for 6 h and vacuum-filtered using Tecan Te-Vac to remove any precipitates. The concentration of the compound in the filtrate was measured via UV absorbance (λ: 250–498 nm). The filtrate drug concentration was determined by comparing the fully solubilized reference plate which contains 17 µM of compound dissolved in spectroscopically pure n-propanol. All compounds were tested in duplicates. The kinetic solubility (µg/mL) of compounds was calculated using the µSOL Evolution software. The three experimental controls used were albendazole (low solubility), phenazopyridine (moderate solubility) and furosemide (high solubility).

        <p>
            The substrate depletion assay was employed to determine metabolic stability, using an established mid-density (384-well format) protocol<sup>1</sup>. The workflow included a robotic system for incubation and sample clean-up, coupled with an automated ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) method for sample analysis. Briefly, each 110 µL reaction mixture consisted of 1 µM test article, supersomes, and an NADPH regenerating system in 100mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. The specific protein and enzyme concentrations, as well as the control compounds utilized are listed in Table 1. Incubations were conducted at 37°C, with mixing, and reaction aliquots were quenched at 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 min by addition of cold acetonitrile (ACN) with internal standard (IS), i.e. albendazole. Centrifugation at 3000 g, 4 °C for 20 min, was used to clear samples of precipitated protein and debris. Sample analysis in an UHPLC-HRMS instrument, data extraction, and half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) determinations were performed as previously described<sup>1</sup>.

        </h3>
        <p>
            The P450-Glo inhibition assay is a luminescent technique used to detect CYP activity, through the liberation of luciferin from CYP probe substrates. P450-Glo assays were performed using a previously described method with minor modifications<sup>2</sup>. Briefly, 2 µL of CYP-substrate mix was dispensed into medium-binding white/solid 1,536-well plates using a Flying Reagent Dispenser (FRD, Aurora Discovery, Carlsbad, CA) with the exception of adding Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) to the mixture for CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. The initial optimization assays for CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 yielded lower signal to background ratios and higher well to well variation. To increase signal and prevent adhesion of protein to tubes of the plate dispenser, 0.4% BSA was added to these two enzyme assays. 23 nL of each positive control (columns 1-4) and test compound (columns 5-48) dissolved in DMSO was transferred to the assay plates using a Wako Pintool station (Wako Automation, San Diego, CA). Positive controls used in these experiments are listed in Table 2. After the control/test compounds were transferred, the assay plates were incubated at room temperature (RT) for 10 min before the addition of 2 µL NADPH regeneration solution using an FRD. The reaction incubation continued at either RT or 37 °C for 60 min, and then quenched by FRD addition of 4 µL of the detection reagent. After a 20 min incubation at room temperature, the luminescence intensity was measured and quantified using a ViewLux plate reader (PerkinElmer, Shelton, CT). Data was expressed as relative luminescence units.
