            ADME@NCATS is a resource developed for the scientific community by NCATS to host in silico prediction models
            for different ADME endpoints. The resource allows prediction of different pharmacokinetic properties of
            small molecules which is potentially useful for structure optimization in early drug discovery. Users can
            provide input as a CSV file containing SMILES or an SDF file containing a maximum of 1000 compounds. For
            each compound, the predictions from the models are provided as output along with the confidence scores.
            Currently, the website hosts models for predicting liver microsomal stability of small molecules using
            experimental data generated in rat liver microsomes (RLM). We plan to add prediction models for other ADME
            endpoints as soon as they become available. Those users who cannot upload their data are encouraged to
            download the self-contained instance of ADME@NCATS that can be run locally.
        </p>

            A subset of data that were used for developing the models are provided for download. The users are
            encouraged to use these data for development and validation of future QSAR models.
