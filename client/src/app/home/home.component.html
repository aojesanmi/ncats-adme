            ADME@NCATS is a resource developed by NCATS to host in silico prediction models for various ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion) properties. The resource serves as an important tool for the drug discovery community with potential uses in compound optimization and prioritization. The models were retrospectively validated on a subset of <a href="https://ncats.nih.gov/expertise/preclinical/npc" target="_blank">marketed drugs</a> which resulted in very good accuracies.

            Users can provide input as a CSV or text file containing SMILES. Alternatively, the users can sketch a molecule using the molecule editor provided. For each compound, the predictions from the models are provided as output along with the confidence scores. Those users who cannot upload their data are encouraged to download the <a href="https://github.com/ncats/ncats-adme/" target="_blank" admeTrackLinkEvent evLabel="github">self-contained instance of ADME@NCATS</a> that can be run locally.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Data that were used for developing the models are made publicly accessible by depositing them into PubChem database. In some instances, when complete data cannot be made public, a subset of the data are deposited into PubChem. Links to the PubChem assays can be found in the individual model pages. The users are highly encouraged to use these data for development and validation of QSAR models.
